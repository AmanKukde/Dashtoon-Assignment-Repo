# Neural Style Transfer using VGG-19 (Includes Explanation)
This repo contains the code file and generated examples. The style copied is VanGogh's Stary Night Examples are: SRK's image and one Scenery.
The model uses VGG19 as a feature extraction pipeline. The outputs from 5 blocks are taken and loss is calculated using that. Loss functions used are MSE and Gram Matrix.
The file name format is {generated_after_X_iterations}
